## Language-specific Rules

### TypeScript / JavaScript

- Prefer type-safe solutions; avoid `any`.
- Handle `null` and `undefined` explicitly.
- Use `await` for promise chains.
- Throw `Error` objects, not strings.

### Rust

- All code must compile with `cargo check`.
- Follow idiomatic Rust style.
- Use ownership, borrowing, pattern matching idiomatically.

### Go

- Follow standard Go conventions.
- Handle errors explicitly, no silent swallowing.
- Use meaningful package boundaries.

## CodeGraph

When answering structural or codebase questions, use CodeGraph before broad filesystem searches. This is a hard ordering rule for repo maps, architecture, call flow, dependencies, symbol references, impact analysis, and "how does X work" questions.

Required order for structural/codebase questions:

1. Resolve the project root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel || pwd`.
2. Confirm the root is a real project/workspace. Do not ask the user before initializing CodeGraph in a real project. Do not initialize CodeGraph in `$HOME`, temporary directories, or non-project folders.
3. Check for `<project-root>/.codegraph/` before any broad Read/Glob/Grep filesystem exploration.
4. If `.codegraph/` is missing and CodeGraph is enabled/available, immediately run `codegraph init <project-root>` once, then use the `codegraph_explore` MCP tool or `codegraph explore "..."`.
5. Missing .codegraph/ is the trigger to initialize, not a reason to skip CodeGraph. Do not fall back just because `.codegraph/` is missing; a missing index is the trigger to lazy-initialize, not a reason to skip CodeGraph.
6. Only fall back after CodeGraph init or CodeGraph use fails. Only fall back to normal filesystem tools after CodeGraph init or CodeGraph use fails, and briefly explain the fallback.

Broad Read/Glob/Grep exploration before this CodeGraph check is explicitly discouraged for structural/codebase questions.
