# Atlas Persistence Contract

Atlas is a first-class persistence backend for user-facing knowledge and work management. Use it when the user asks to create, read, update, organize, or track durable workspace records in Atlas.

Atlas is not a replacement for Engram session memory or the default Obsidian SDD artifact store unless the user explicitly chooses Atlas as the destination.

## Contract Scope

This contract describes how agents should use an already configured Atlas instance. It must stay project-agnostic:

- Do not assume a local Atlas source checkout or repository path.
- Do not assume workspace, project, folder, board, column, document, or task identifiers.
- Do not assume the current coding repository maps to an Atlas workspace/project.
- Discover all runtime targets through Atlas MCP or CLI before reading or mutating.

Atlas behavior this contract relies on:

- Atlas exposes markdown knowledge, kanban tasks, projects, workspaces, search, and metadata through one shared backend.
- Atlas MCP is the preferred agent interface and uses the same API semantics as other Atlas clients.
- Atlas document content writes are revision-based compare-and-swap operations.
- Atlas task and document update tools use PATCH semantics.
- Atlas destructive operations require explicit confirmation semantics.

## Backend Role

Atlas persists collaborative workspace objects:

- Workspaces: tenant/collaboration boundary.
- Projects: grouping for notes, folders, boards, and project-scoped sharing.
- Folders: document organization inside a project.
- Documents: markdown notes with revisions, frontmatter, wikilinks, backlinks, and attachments.
- Boards and columns: kanban planning surfaces.
- Tasks: work items with readable IDs, labels, priorities, assignees, references, checklists, subtasks, attachments, and activity.
- Tags, saved searches, task views, members, audit feeds, and other workspace metadata.

Use Atlas when the user wants information to be visible and durable in an Atlas workspace: notes, decisions meant for humans, project plans, task boards, task references, backlog items, status updates, or workspace knowledge.

## MCP Surface

Prefer the `atlas` MCP server whenever its tools are available. It exposes tools and resources; it does not expose prompts.

### Resources

Atlas advertises document resources with this URI template:

```text
atlas:///{workspace}/{slug}
```

- `workspace` is a workspace slug.
- `slug` is a document slug or UUID.
- Resource reads return document bodies as `text/markdown`.
- Use resource reads for direct document body retrieval when the URI is already known; otherwise discover documents with tools first.

### Authentication and attribution

- Stdio MCP mode uses a startup bearer token from the Atlas MCP host configuration.
- HTTP MCP mode requires `Authorization: Bearer atlas_<token>` per request.
- Prefer API-key credentials for agent workflows so Atlas can attribute actions to an agent principal instead of a human user.
- Never print, log, echo, or persist Atlas tokens, API keys, session tokens, root passwords, webhook secrets, or activation links.

### General tool conventions

- Discover before mutating.
- List calls return paginated envelopes such as `{items, next_cursor, has_more}`; continue with the returned cursor when a complete result set is needed.
- Heavy reads are compact by default; request full detail only when necessary for editing, verification, or quoting exact content.
- PATCH tools distinguish omitted fields from explicit `null`: omitted means leave unchanged; `null` means clear where supported.
- Destructive tools require explicit user confirmation and `confirm: true` where supported.
- Some write tools resolve boards/columns by name and may return actionable ambiguity or valid-option errors; do not guess after ambiguity.

## MCP Tool Capabilities

Use the tool names available in the MCP host. In Pi they are typically exposed with an `atlas_` prefix.

### Discovery and reads

Use these before writes and for normal browsing:

- `atlas_ping` — confirm the MCP server is reachable.
- `atlas_search` — search documents and tasks across a workspace.
- `atlas_list_workspaces` — discover accessible workspaces.
- `atlas_list_projects` — discover projects in a workspace.
- `atlas_list_documents`, `atlas_get_document` — browse and retrieve documents.
- `atlas_list_folders` — inspect document organization.
- `atlas_list_boards`, `atlas_list_columns` — discover task board structure before creating or moving tasks.
- `atlas_list_tasks`, `atlas_get_task` — browse and retrieve tasks by readable ID.
- `atlas_list_tags`, `atlas_list_used_labels` — inspect tag/label vocabulary.
- `atlas_list_members` — discover user and API-key principals for assignments.
- `atlas_list_saved_searches`, `atlas_list_task_views` — discover saved workspace views.
- `atlas_get_task_references`, `atlas_get_task_backlinks`, `atlas_get_document_backlinks` — inspect relationships.
- `atlas_list_checklist`, `atlas_list_activity`, `atlas_list_workspace_activity` — inspect task/workspace history and state.
- `atlas_list_document_history`, `atlas_get_document_revision` — inspect document revision history and exact historical content.
- `atlas_list_attachments` — inspect attachment metadata.
- `atlas_get_workspace_audit`, `atlas_get_platform_audit` — inspect audit data when the user asks and permissions allow.

### Document and folder writes

Use these for markdown knowledge persistence:

- `atlas_create_document` — create a markdown document in a project.
- `atlas_update_document_metadata` — rename or move a document without changing content.
- `atlas_update_document_content` — update markdown content using compare-and-swap revision semantics.
- `atlas_move_document`, `atlas_copy_document`, `atlas_delete_document` — reorganize or remove documents.
- `atlas_create_folder`, `atlas_rename_folder`, `atlas_move_folder`, `atlas_copy_folder`, `atlas_delete_folder` — manage folder hierarchy.

Document write protocol:

1. Discover workspace and project.
2. Find the target document by search/list/get, or create it only after confirming it does not already exist.
3. Before content updates, call `atlas_get_document` with full detail and keep the returned revision ID.
4. Submit `atlas_update_document_content` with that base revision ID.
5. On a conflict, inspect the conflict response, re-read current content or apply the returned patch, and retry only when the intended edit is still valid.
6. Never overwrite current document content from stale context.

### Task and planning writes

Use these for work tracking:

- `atlas_create_task` — create a task on a board/column.
- `atlas_update_task` — patch task fields such as title, description, priority, estimate, due date, labels, or custom properties.
- `atlas_move_task` — move a task between columns/statuses.
- `atlas_delete_task` — delete a task only after explicit confirmation.
- `atlas_add_task_assignee`, `atlas_remove_task_assignee` — manage assignment.
- `atlas_add_task_reference`, `atlas_remove_task_reference` — link tasks/documents or related work.
- `atlas_add_checklist_item`, `atlas_update_checklist_item`, `atlas_delete_checklist_item`, `atlas_promote_checklist_item` — manage checklist items and promote them to tasks.
- `atlas_create_subtask`, `atlas_promote_subtask` — create or promote full subtasks.

Task write protocol:

1. Discover workspace, project, board, and column.
2. Use readable task IDs returned by Atlas, such as `ATL-42`, for follow-up operations.
3. Preserve existing fields unless the user asked to change them.
4. Treat labels/tags as user-facing vocabulary: list existing labels/tags before inventing new ones when consistency matters.
5. Prefer references/subtasks/checklists over flattening all context into a single task description when Atlas structure better represents the work.

### Workspace structure writes

Use these only when the user asks to manage Atlas structure:

- `atlas_create_board`, `atlas_update_board`, `atlas_delete_board`.
- `atlas_create_column`, `atlas_update_column`, `atlas_delete_column`.
- `atlas_create_project`, `atlas_update_project`, `atlas_delete_project`.
- `atlas_create_tag`, `atlas_update_tag`, `atlas_delete_tag`.
- `atlas_create_status_template`, `atlas_update_status_template`, `atlas_delete_status_template`.
- `atlas_create_saved_search`, `atlas_rename_saved_search`, `atlas_delete_saved_search`.
- `atlas_create_task_view`, `atlas_update_task_view`, `atlas_delete_task_view`.

These operations affect shared workspace organization. Confirm intent, discover existing structure first, and avoid creating duplicates.

## MCP Gaps and Fallbacks

Atlas MCP intentionally does not cover every Atlas capability. If the user asks for a missing operation, use the Atlas CLI or ask for guidance.

Common MCP gaps include:

- no prompt capability;
- no user/admin management tools;
- no API-key management tools;
- no group, grant, or property-definition tools;
- no workspace create/update/admin-delete tools;
- no webhook, integration-config, or automation-rule tools;
- no attachment upload/download/delete tools through MCP; MCP lists attachment metadata only.

When falling back to CLI:

- Keep the same discovery-first and confirmation rules.
- Use JSON output when scripting or when exact fields matter.
- Do not put tokens on the command line if avoidable; prefer existing config, environment provided by the user, or stdin-based token setup.
- Remember that workspace-scoped CLI commands need an explicit workspace when no default is configured.

## Persistence Boundaries

Use Atlas for:

- durable user-facing notes and task/project records;
- workspace knowledge that should be visible in the Atlas web UI;
- task status, references, assignees, labels, checklists, and subtasks;
- human-readable documentation when the user names Atlas as the destination;
- project planning records that should be shared beyond the current Pi session.

Do not use Atlas for:

- Pi harness runtime configuration;
- subagent model assignments or `/agents` state;
- Engram memory observations or lifecycle metadata;
- Obsidian vault maintenance unless the user asks to import/export or sync with Atlas;
- OpenSpec/SDD artifacts by default.

For SDD flows, Engram plus Obsidian remain the default Pi Harness persistence path. Atlas may store a copy or public-facing note/task only when explicitly requested by the user or when an SDD task says Atlas is the target backend.

When a result is saved to Atlas and is also important future agent context, also save a concise Engram pointer with the Atlas workspace, object type, slug/readable ID, and why it matters.

## Safety Checklist

Before mutating Atlas, confirm:

- Target workspace/project/board/column/document/task was discovered, not guessed.
- The operation matches the user's requested destination and scope.
- Document content edits are based on the latest revision ID.
- PATCH fields are intentionally omitted, set, or cleared.
- Destructive actions have explicit user confirmation and the required confirmation flag.
- No secret values will be printed, logged, saved to Engram, or copied into documents/tasks.

If any item is uncertain, ask the user or perform another read-only discovery step before writing.

## Relationship to Other Persistence Backends

| Backend | Primary role | Default for |
|---|---|---|
| Engram | Agent/session memory and SDD recovery pointers | durable agent context, summaries, decisions, SDD topic keys |
| Obsidian | Human-readable local notes/artifacts | full SDD artifacts and vault notes |
| Atlas | Collaborative workspace knowledge and tasks | user-facing documents, boards, tasks, workspace records |
| OpenSpec/files | Repository-tracked specs | explicit file-backed or team-reviewable SDD artifacts |
